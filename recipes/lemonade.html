        <p>When life gives you lemons, make the Best Lemonade Ever! This aptly named recipe is as good as it gets: Sweet,

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ¾ cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>9 medium lemons, or more as needed</li>
            <li>7 cups ice-cold water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine sugar and 1 cup water in a small saucepan. Stir to dissolve sugar while mixture comes to a boil. Set
            aside to cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, roll lemons around on your counter to soften. Cut in half lengthwise, and squeeze into a liquid measuring
            cup. Add pulp to the juice, but discard any seeds. Continue juicing until you have 1 1/2 cups fresh juice and pulp.
            </li>
            <li>Pour 7 cups ice-cold water into a pitcher. Stir in lemon juice and pulp, then add simple syrup to taste. Add ice.</li>
